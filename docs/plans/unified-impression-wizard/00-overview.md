# Unified Impression Wizard — Overview

## Status: Proposed

## Goal

Replace the two existing wizards (`NewRenovationPage` and `NewImpressionPage`)
with a single unified wizard at `/new-impression`. Move image acquisition
(camera, upload+crop, paste+crop) into dedicated pages that hand off to the
unified wizard via IndexedDB. The wizard is refresh-safe: on reload, it reads
the source image from IndexedDB and resumes at the first stage.

   └── click Result     → /new-impression?source=impression&renovation=:id&impression=:i
                          (preview stage first)
```

In the preview stage the wizard shows the same maskable image and three
controls: `back`, `trash`, `next change`. Starting to paint OR pressing
`next change` transitions to the mask stage in-place (no navigation).

## Decisions baked in (confirm or override)

These are the foundational choices used in the rest of the plan. Override
any before implementation begins.

| # | Decision | Default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | IndexedDB access | Thin in-house wrapper around the native `indexedDB` API, no new dependency | Tiny surface area; existing code already does direct platform APIs |
| 2 | Stored value type | `Blob` (image/webp), 1024×1024 | Matches what we upload to Storage; smaller than data URLs; survives refresh |
| 3 | Routing shape | Flat: `/photo`, `/crop`, `/new-impression`. Renovation/impression IDs travel in the **query string** | Matches your wording; lets photo/crop reuse the same wizard before any renovation exists |
| 4 | `?source` values | `photo`, `crop`, `original`, `impression` (replaces old `before` / `<id>`) | Matches your plan; explicit per-source semantics |
| 5 | Required query params per source | `photo`, `crop`: none beyond `source`. `original`: `renovation`. `impression`: `renovation` & `impression` | Wizard can re-fetch the right Storage path on refresh |
| 6 | "Trash" semantics in preview stage | `source=impression` → delete that impression (existing behaviour). `source=original` → confirm-then-delete the whole renovation. `source=photo`/`crop` → discard IDB blob and return to `/renovations` | Mirrors current behaviour for impression; the only sensible action for original is to delete the renovation |
| 7 | After Generate | Wait for completion, write `resultImagePath` blob into `IDB[impressionSource]`, then `router.replace` to `/new-impression?source=impression&renovation=R&impression=I` (preview stage). Same code path as clicking the result on the timeline. | Unifies the result view; refresh stays correct; "Next Change" needs no special case |
| 8 | Result path while generating | Stay on `/new-impression` showing the **processing** stage. Source layout (header + same maskable image area, texts hidden) does not shift. | Keeps the layout invariant the plan calls for |
| 9 | Live camera page survival | Keep a dedicated `PhotoCapturePage.vue` (copied from `old/CameraCapturePage.vue`). The `data-testid="camera-input"` file-input bypass on `NewRenovationCard` is preserved (E2E uses it) but its handler now writes IDB + navigates to `/new-impression?source=photo`. | E2E tests rely on the file-input bypass; keeping it avoids needing a `getUserMedia` mock |
| 10 | Old code removal | Delete `src/views/renovation/old/` and routes in the same commit as the cutover. | The repo already lives on a feature branch; no two-shipping concerns |

## Open questions for you

1. **Decision 6, original→trash**: Is "delete the entire renovation" right, or
   should `trash` from `source=original` simply navigate back to the timeline
   (i.e. cancel)? **Default in plan: confirm-then-delete.**
2. **Decision 7 redirect target**: After Generate, the page redirects to
   `?source=impression`. Some users might prefer no URL change so that "Back"
   returns to the previous source. Confirm OK with the redirect.
3. **Decision 9, camera input**: E2E tests use `[data-testid="camera-input"]`
   `setInputFiles` to bypass `getUserMedia`. Should we keep that bypass on the
   renovations card (option A) or move it onto `PhotoCapturePage` itself
   (option B)? **Default: A.**
4. **Naming**: Path `/new-impression` (your wording) vs `/wizard` vs
   `/impression/new`. **Default: `/new-impression` per your plan.**
